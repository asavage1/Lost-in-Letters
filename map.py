    # Declare 2d array for map: Option 1: One 2d array that can expand any
    #                                     way but up
    #                                  2: 2 2d arrays that can expand only 2
    #                                     ways, both expand down, the left
    #                                     one expands "left" and the right
    #                                     one expands "right"
    # Option 1 may make it hard to keep track of player coordinates

    # Initialize elements of array:
    #    1. Initialize sky (spaces)
    #    2. Initialize surface layer
    #    3. Initialize other layers (TBD)
    #    4. Initialize special objects (Later versions)
